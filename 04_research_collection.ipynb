      "Authors: Jiayu Wang\n",
      "Abstract: The Arctic is undergoing rapid weather changes, posing a grave threat to the iconic animal that inhabits the region - the polar bear. This paper reviews the tremendous impacts of climate change on the ecological diversity of polar bears, examining in detail the changes to their distribution, habitat use, food supply, and population numbers. The current understanding of their environmental evolution and adaptability remains insufficient. This conference underscores that studying polar bears benefits the whole world, as they are a fascinating megafauna and a defining symbol of the Arctic. The report consolidates obvious survey findings, articulates the urgent need to study environmental conservation issues further, and proposes initiatives going forward. In summary, this story ties the conservation of polar bears to maintaining the fragile balance in the Arctic, as climate change brings growing disturbances to ecosystems globally. Further investigating these interlinked relationships and taking targeted conservation measures will aid efforts to preserve this vibrant yet fragile polar region.\n",

      "Authors: J. Aars\n",
      "Abstract: Although the Arctic has experienced previous periods of warmer climate, the rate of sea ice loss in recent decades is likely faster than polar bears have ever experienced. The rapidly changing climate means that any response in polar bear behavior is unlikely to be driven by microevolution, but rather it will depend on behavioral plasticity. Fortunately, studies indicate high behavioral plasticity in polar bears despite their marked specialization as a marine predator. Although seals are their primary prey, polar bears feed opportunistically on a variety of marine and terrestrial prey and vegetation. Recently, the greatest change in their feeding behavior has resulted from spending more time on land as seasonal sea ice recedes. Additionally, polar bears will encounter new prey as some temperate species extend their ranges northward. Changes in polar bear movements and habitat associations because of climate change vary among subpopulations. In several areas, the loss of sea ice has altered migration routes, required long-distance swimming between hunting and denning areas, and resulted in some denning areas becoming inaccessible. Because polar bears do not occur in regions without sea ice for a significant part of the year, a diet of seals may not be fully replaceable with alternative terrestrial food, which poses a serious conservation concern.\n",

      "Abstract: Abstract Climate change threatens global biodiversity. Many species vulnerable to climate change are important to humans for nutritional, cultural, and economic reasons. Polar bears Ursus maritimus are threatened by sea‐ice loss and represent a subsistence resource for Indigenous people. We applied a novel population modeling‐management framework that is based on species life history and accounts for habitat loss to evaluate subsistence harvest for the Chukchi Sea (CS) polar bear subpopulation. Harvest strategies followed a state‐dependent approach under which new data were used to update the harvest on a predetermined management interval. We found that a harvest strategy with a starting total harvest rate of 2.7% (˜85 bears/yr at current abundance), a 2:1 male‐to‐female ratio, and a 10‐yr management interval would likely maintain subpopulation abundance above maximum net productivity level for the next 35 yr (approximately three polar bear generations), our primary criterion for sustainability. Plausible bounds on starting total harvest rate were 1.7–3.9%, where the range reflects uncertainty due to sampling variation, environmental variation, model selection, and differing levels of risk tolerance. The risk of undesired demographic outcomes (e.g., overharvest) was positively related to harvest rate, management interval, and projected declines in environmental carrying capacity; and negatively related to precision in population data. Results reflect several lines of evidence that the CS subpopulation has been productive in recent years, although it is uncertain how long this will last as sea‐ice loss continues. Our methods provide a template for balancing trade‐offs among protection, use, research investment, and other factors. Demographic risk assessment and state‐dependent management will become increasingly important for harvested species, like polar bears, that exhibit spatiotemporal variation in their response to climate change.\n",

      "Authors: Robert C. Lacy, Kit M. Kovacs, C. Lydersen, Jon Aars\n",
      "Abstract: Arctic ecosystems are especially vulnerable to the impacts of climate change because of the limit to possible northward shifts for species dependent on land or continental shelf and because the rate of warming of the region has been 2-4 x the global average in recent decades. The decline in sea ice in the Arctic has both direct and indirect impacts on the species that live in association with ice, breeding on it, traveling over it, feeding on other ice-dependent species or avoiding competition with subarctic species that cannot exploit resources in ice-covered areas. Herein, we present a metamodel of a top-level predator, the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), and two of its key prey species, ringed seals (Pusa hispida) and bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus), which are important in maintaining current polar bear densities and in turn are strongly influenced by bear predation. We used a metamodel that links Population Viability Analyses of the three species in order to examine how the impacts of declining spring land-fast sea ice on the fjords of Svalbard (Norway) and Frans Josef Land (Russia) can cascade through this predator-prey system. As the ice conditions that allow ringed seals to raise pups in snow-covered lairs on the frozen fjords diminish, or even disappear, ringed seal populations using the land-fast sea ice will collapse due to lack of successful recruitment. Consequently, the polar bear population, which relies heavily on hunting ringed seals in the land-fast sea ice to be able to raise their own offspring is also likely to decline. Our models suggest time-lags of decades, with the polar bear population not entering into decline until the lack of recruitment of ringed seals results in the depletion of breeding age ringed seals – starting in the third decade from the start point of the model and dropping below the initial population size only some decades later. Although lags between climate change and impacts on the ice-associated fauna are expected, the sea ice conditions have already changed dramatically in the northern Barents Sea region, including the Svalbard Archipelago, and the collapse of this Arctic species assemblage might already be underway.\n",

      "Abstract: The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) has become a symbol of the threat to biodiversity from climate change. Understanding polar bear evolutionary history may provide insights into apex carnivore responses and prospects during periods of extreme environmental perturbations. In recent years, genomic studies have examined bear speciation and population history, including evidence for ancient admixture between polar bears and brown bears (Ursus arctos). Here, we extend our earlier studies of a 130,000–115,000-year-old polar bear from the Svalbard Archipelago using a 10X coverage genome sequence and ten new genomes of polar and brown bears from contemporary zones of overlap in northern Alaska. We demonstrate a dramatic decline in effective population size for this ancient polar bear’s lineage, followed by a modest increase just before its demise. A slightly higher genetic diversity in the ancient polar bear suggests a severe genetic erosion over a prolonged bottleneck in modern polar bears. Statistical fitting of data to alternative admixture graph scenarios favors at least one ancient introgression event from brown bears into the ancestor of polar bears, possibly dating back over 150,000 yea\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mBased on the search results, here are three selections:\n",
